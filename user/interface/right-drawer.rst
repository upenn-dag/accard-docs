External Data Drawer
====================

.. warning::
    This feature is not currently available.

The right drawer has been reserved for the external data viewer. One of the main use-case examples for Accard is to view and consolidate data from external systems into one, unified system. The external data drawer will provide a glimpse into your external systems; allowing you to view data from any of those systems without ever leaving Accard.

Proposed Features
-----------------

* Infinite number of external systems.
* Unified data access across any system.
* Drag & drop data from external system directly into your form.
* Display patient specific data by MRN (if system supports MRN).

**We need you!** In order to make this Accard module a reality, we will need you to help us build it. We need to know which systems are of the most importance to you, the customer. We need to know if you believe this is worthwhile. We think so!
