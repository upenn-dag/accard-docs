To understand how to use Accard, you first have to understand some very basic concepts and terms. In this section, we outline these ideas, and expand upon them. At its core, Accard is very simple. It may seem to be a complex web of interlinking systems, but if you take the time to understand the pieces; the sum of the parts becomes very simple to understand.

.. note::
    This guide uses the :doc:`Sample Application <../sample-application/index>` to illustrate how to perform common tasks in Accard. The sandbox is used by more than one person, so you may find that some data may be missing, or different than you see here; this is normal.

In this section, we explain how to accomplish common tasks within Accard. To follow along with these tasks, you may wish to :ref:`request access to the sandbox<sample-application-access>`.
