Attribute
=========

Attributes are the simplest Accard resource, defining no required fields on the
resource itself.

.. note::
    Attributes are the only resource within Accard that *do not* require a date.
    These resources do not fall on a timeline by default, but adding a custom
    date field will allow you to capture where an attribute falls on the timeline.
