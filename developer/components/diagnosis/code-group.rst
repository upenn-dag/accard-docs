Code Group
==========

Code groups are used in many ways in the applciation. Primarily, they are used
to mark a diagnosis as having been a specific type of disease.

.. note::
    The "main" code group is **mandatory** as the diagnosis relevant areas of
    the application **will not** function without this being present.
