Deleting a Patient
==================

.. note::
    This feature is not currently available!

Deleting a patient is a very destructive action that, more often than not, has unintended consequences in terms of data loss. Let's assume that you wish to delete John Smith from our Sample Application. If you wish to delete him, you must also delete his *entire* set of supporting data; including diagnoses, activities, attributes, behaviors, phases, regimens, and samples!

This is definitely possible. However, instead of allowing that kind of destruction without a good way of knowing what you're deleting; we are developing a feature that will first summarize all data that will be deleted **before** actually deleting it. This will give you the opportunity to first review the data before you remove it entirely.
