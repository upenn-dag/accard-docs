Patient Grid
============

.. note::
    We are **always** open to suggestions on how to improve Accard. At this time, we are specifically interested in improving this interface element!

The patient grid is the bread and butter of the Accard application. It allows you to find and manage your patient population quickly, leaving you to be able to get back to work!

Selecting a Patient
-------------------

Selecting your patient in Accard is a powerful action. Accard has been designed from the ground up to focus specifically on your patients; as such, Accard will naturally adapt to any action which indicates you wish to know more about any one patient.

Single Click
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Single clicking on a patient will set the patient to be the "active patient". Upon activating the patient, the interface will adapt around that patient. You'll notice several areas of the interface change, and all functionality in those areas will then be attributed to that specific patient.

This action is to be taken when you wish to manage one patient, but do not with to focus *only* on that patient.

Double Click
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Double clicking will also activate the patient. Additionally, it will close the grid and open the patient details sub-application.

This action is to be taken when you wish to manage one, specific patient as opposed to bulk data management allowed in the grid. From here, you'll be able to:

.. todo::
    Link actual help documentation once created.

* Add a diagnosis
* Edit an activity
* Create a patient phase
* and more...

Sorting
-------

All columns of data within the grid are sortable. Clicking on any cell in the header row will cause the table to sort by that field, in ascending order. Clicking that same cell again will sort records by that field, but in descending order.

Filtering
---------

Filtering is accomodated by the Patient Filter inspector. :doc:`Read more about it in the next section <inspectors>`, and see how it affects the grid.
