.. warning::
    This feature is not currently available. The foundation has been built, now we just need to decorate!

Trays contain data that, typically, would require leaving the page you are currently viewing. Instead of having you bounce from website to website; constantly losing your place or having a massive amount of open tabs, we have created a space in which to show you the data you need without ever leaving Accard.

**We need you!** The trays feature is currently able to show and hide individual trays. This is, basically, the foundation of the feature. We need to know what trays you wish to see inside of your applications. What data do you wish to have on-hand, instantly accessible?

Below, we've created the basis for, what we believe to be, important information to comprise a few trays. This is not the end, **this is not all that is possible**; it simply serves as an example of what *could* be contained in trays.

Help
----

Will display sub-application specific help documentation. The help documents shown will change as you navigate through different Accard sub-applications. For instance, when browsing a specific patient, you will be shown help on how to create an activity.

In addition, we wish this area to contain customer customizable SOP entries.

Notes
-----

Will provide an area in which to leave yourself, or other users, notes and commentary on a specific record or action. The notes will be specific to the active patient, or sub-application.

Status
------

Will show the current accessibility of various Accard connected systems in real-time. This will inform you if an external (or Accard internal) system has been taken offline for any reason.

Tickets
-------

Will show you your active DAG tickets, and allow you to create, update, close, etc any ticket which belongs to you.
