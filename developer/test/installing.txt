This is done by adding the following code to the ``composer.json`` file.

.. code-block:: js

    {
        // ...
        "require-dev": {
            "codeception/codeception": "dev-master",
            "codeception/mockery-module": "dev-master"
        },
        "config": {
            "bin-dir": "bin"
        }
    }

Once these lines have been added, run ``composer update`` to download the Codeception and Mockery libraries to your Composer ``vendor`` folder.
